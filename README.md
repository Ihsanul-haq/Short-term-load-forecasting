# Short-term-load-forecasting
Comparative analysis of ML models for short term load forecasting, applied on three datasets.
Here, I have applied four ML models to three different datasets namely, week 24, week 15 (week 15 and week 24  datasets have been taken from @GEFCOM 2012 and 2014 data) and ISONE datasets.
ML models are LSTM, GRU, LSTM-CNN and GRU-CNN.
ALL the graphs for four models have also been given in a separate folder.
